    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Cougar Bellinger and I am a software developer and musician. I am currently a senior studying
        Software Engineering at the University of Arizona,
        and I am interested in Full Stack Development, Embedded Software, Digitial Signal Processing, and Project
        Management. I love learning, and after I graduate in 2025,
        I plan on getting my Master's degree after getting 1 or 2 years of work experience. I would also like to gain my
        PhD purely out of interest of learning and contributing to research, but that is a secondary goal for me at the
        moment.
